# Raybox targeting DE0-Nano board

Files in here are for doing a build of Raybox that targets the DE0-Nano FPGA dev/demo board
that is based on the Altera Cyclone IV.

It is intended that you will use these files in Quartus Prime Lite Edition (I'm using "Quartus Prime Version 22.1std.0 Build 915 10/25/2022 SC Lite Edition").

The project relies on Verilog files in `../sim`.
