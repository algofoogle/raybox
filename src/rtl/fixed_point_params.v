// A note on Qm:
// It seems the smaller the player step size, the bigger Qm needs to be. Non-power-of-2 steps could make this worse.
// For instance, with Q12.12, it seems the smallest reliable step quantum is 8, i.e. 8*(2^-12) => 0.001953125.
// This might be made better if we properly check for reciprocal saturation.

//NOTE:
// DON'T FORGET! When changing `Qm or `Qn, you also need to update the LZCs (inc. `SZ)
// and the equivalent values in sim_main.cpp if using the sim.

// These values are for "Distance fixed-point"; a feature specific to the tracer storing visual distance values.
// Because this (probably) needs to go into on-chip memory, we constrain it to hopefully the minimum it needs to be
// (which right now is 16 bits).
//NOTE: Some sort of floating-point could probably work better, and in that case we've observed that probably 7~9 bits
// would be sufficient, plus an exponent. This could even be calculated for us by the `reciprocal` module's LZC.
